The jet engine technology that powers airplanes comes mostly from U.S. companies, but the engines can\\'t function without rare earth minerals that are manufactured largely in China.WASHINGTON: The U.S.-China trade conflict is quickly morphing into a fight over global supply chains, as the two nations limit the sharing of critical technologies that could have lasting consequences for scores of industries.The United States last week suspended some sales to China of components and software used in jet engines and semiconductors, a response to a clampdown by Beijing on the export of minerals used in large sectors of manufacturing. Both sides over the past few days have accused the other of operating in bad faith.The supply chain warfare, which comes on top of tariffs the two countries have inflicted on the other\\'s imports, has alarmed companies that say they cannot make their products without components sourced from both. And it has made officials in Washington increasingly nervous about other choke points where China could squeeze the United States, including pharmaceuticals or shipping.\"The supply chain wars that we\\'ve been speculating about for years are now happening,\" said Liza Tobin, a former White House national security adviser who is now the managing director at Garnaut Global, a risk advisory firm.In recent weeks, the airplane industry has emerged as both a weapon, and a victim, in this fight.Live EventsThe jet engine technology that powers airplanes, and the navigation systems that control them, largely come from the United States, developed by companies like General Electric. In China\\'s quest to build a viable competitor to Boeing, for example, it has had to source engine technology from GE Aerospace.But a jet engine also cannot be made without China. Minerals that are processed there are essential for special coatings and components that help the engine operate smoothly at high temperatures, as well as other uses.Beijing restricted exports of those minerals, known as rare earths, in April after President Donald Trump began imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports.The move has threatened to shutter what is left of advanced manufacturing in the United States -- including the work done by many defense contractors. In May, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets it needed to build cars.The United States responded with its own tech restrictions. Last week, U.S. officials suspended some licenses that allowed American companies to ship airplane technology to China, as well as others related to biotechnology and semiconductors, people familiar with the move say.At the same time, officials in the departments of Defense and Interior and the National Security Council are accelerating efforts to find more domestic supplies of rare earths, including considering U.S. government funding for new mines and processing facilities, people familiar with the matter said.But any such efforts could take years to come to fruition. On average, it has taken the United States 29 years to develop a single mine, according to statistics from S&P.The Trump administration is also weighing further actions. It has been considering including major Chinese chipmakers, as well as units of Chinese technology giants like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, on a so-called entity list that prohibits them from engaging in trade with the United States, people familiar with the discussions said.The supply chain battle has been years in the making. And both countries have been trying to guard against the other\\'s control of strategic goods by diversifying their own sources of supply.After Trump levied tariffs on China during his first term, many American companies established factories in countries outside China, including Vietnam and Mexico. Xi Jinping, China\\'s leader, set out to make his country less reliant on foreign sources of energy and technology by pumping huge investments into factories making semiconductors, solar panels and electric vehicles.Even so, the economies remain deeply integrated, an intractable reality as hundreds of billions of dollars in trade flow across the Pacific each year. While both countries are resolved to reduce their dependencies on the other for national security reasons, doing so will be expensive and painful. NYT News ServiceA cargo ship at Yangshan Port in Shanghai, Feb. 1, 2025. The U.S. and Chinese economies remain deeply integrated, with hundreds of billions of dollars of trade flowing across the Pacific each year. (The New York Times)Since 2022, for example, the United States has been steadily expanding a global system to regulate advanced semiconductors and stop the technology from flowing to China. The rules have been aimed at restricting China\\'s access to artificial intelligence and advanced computing needed to augment its military. But they have been met with fierce resistance from an industry that sees China as an important source of revenue.The United States has extended these export controls around the world, even forbidding companies in other countries from selling products to China if they use American parts, technology or software to manufacture them. While some foreign governments have bristled at these rules, many have fallen in line.This system rests on the idea that the United States should be the sole global power whose rules other countries need to abide by. But for China, rare earth minerals are a way to challenge the American assertion of dominance.Beijing set up a licensing system that allows it to monitor and approve sales of rare earths, and magnets made from them, to companies worldwide. When Trump ratcheted up tariffs on China to 145% in April, Beijing responded by targeting shipments of rare earths, including pausing many of them.In May, American and Chinese officials arranged a meeting in Geneva to try to defuse their trade tensions. The Trump administration had several reasons to try to strike a truce. Companies had been warning of the risk of empty store shelves later this year because of plummeting imports from China, and stock and bond markets were flashing warning signs. But it was China\\'s rare earth restrictions that appeared to put the most pressure on the United States to reach a resolution.Negotiators agreed in Geneva to lower tariffs. As part of the deal, China said it would \"suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April,\" according to a joint statement.U.S. officials say Chinese shipments have yet to return to their previous levels. During an appearance on CNBC on Friday, Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said that the Chinese were \"slow-rolling their compliance\" and that American officials \"haven\\'t seen the flow of some of those critical minerals like they\\'re supposed to be doing.\"Trump was more blunt. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, he wrote that China had \"TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\" adding, \"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusation in a briefing Tuesday, saying that China had \"earnestly implemented\" the consensus reached in Geneva. Chinese officials say it is the United States that broke the deal, including by issuing a notice saying that the use of chips made by Huawei, the Chinese technology firm, anywhere in the world violated U.S. law.\"The U.S., without any factual basis, has smeared and accused China, imposed export controls on chips, suspended sales of chip design software to China and announced the cancellation of Chinese student visas -- extreme measures that severely undermine the Geneva Consensus and harm China\\'s legitimate rights and interests,\" Lin said.While some U.S. auto and electronics makers have recently received licenses from China for mineral shipments, the uncertainty and continued backlog of requests for the products are continuing to make companies nervous. China had also appeared to be giving preference to European companies over American ones.The tensions are spilling over into other aspects of the United States\\' diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration has also proposed plans to \"aggressively revoke\" visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Communist Party.It is unclear how the tensions can be defused. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Monday that Trump and Xi would likely speak in a call this week. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said he had \"no information to offer\" on the call.Daniel H. Rosen, the co-founder of Rhodium Group, a research company, said that Beijing recognised years ago that rare earths would be central to advanced technologies and subsidised the build-out of those supplies. The United States, he added, \"horribly underestimated\" the demand for them.China mines 70% of the world\\'s rare earths, but it does the chemical processing for 90% of them. The country also makes more than 80% of the world\\'s batteries, more than 70% of its electric cars, and about half of the world\\'s steel, iron and aluminum, according to data from the International Energy Agency.Securing an alternative supply would likely require the United States to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, Rosen said, and cooperation with global partners who were willing to work to set up supply chains outside China.\"It\\'s going to be expensive,\" he said. \"We have a long way to go.\"While some shipments of minerals have restarted, many U.S. industries remain anxious about shortages of supplies. Paul Triolo, a partner at Albright Stonebridge Group, said that the Chinese licensing system was cumbersome and that there had been a notable drop in shipments of critical minerals since the start of April, when Trump first issued astronomical tariffs on China.Triolo said the United States had no choice except to negotiate with Beijing on the issue, as well as set up a long-term strategy with other countries to reduce its dependence on China over the next five to seven years.\"This problem is deep and long lasting,\" he said. \"It will not go away, or be easily solved.\"Read More News onglobal tradetrade warus vs chinajet engineschina rare earthtrump tariffsRead More News onglobal tradetrade warus vs chinajet engineschina rare earthtrump tariffsPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionCrash.

Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that both nations are negotiating a fair, balanced framework. Talks have reportedly progressed on mutual terms that could benefit businesses and consumers. While the China agreement addresses rare earth exports, India remains the next focus in Washington’s trade push, with both sides looking to finalise an agreement soon.APPresident Donald Trump speaks at an event to promote his domestic policy and budget agenda in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, June 26, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)United States President Donald Trump on Thursday indicated that a major trade agreement with India could be on the way. Speaking at the “Big Beautiful Bill” event at the White House, Trump confirmed a deal with China and hinted at an even more significant development involving India.“Everybody wants to make a deal and have a part of it,” Trump said. “Remember a few months ago, the press was saying, ‘You really have anybody of any interest? Well, we just signed with China yesterday. We are having some great deals. We have one coming up, maybe with India. Very big one. Where we're going to open up India, in the China deal, we are starting to open up China,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.He also made it clear that not every country would get the same treatment. “We're not going to make deals with everybody. Some we are just going to send them a letter, say thank you very much. You are to pay 25, 35, 45 per cent. That's the easy way to do it, and my people don't want to do it that way. They want to do some of it, but they want to make more deals than I would do,” Trump added.— ANI (@ANI) India says deal will be fair, balanced, and mutually beneficialIn response to growing speculation, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed earlier this month that New Delhi and Washington are actively working on a bilateral trade pact.Live Events“PM Narendra Modi and US President Trump met in February 2025... Both our leaders have decided to enter into a bilateral trade agreement which will be mutually beneficial for both the economies, businesses on both sides and the people of both countries,” Goyal said during a press conference on 10 June.“We are negotiating to make a nice, fair, equitable and balanced agreement to promote business,” he said.Goyal also underlined the importance of the strategic relationship between the two countries. “The United States and India are very close friends, allies and strategic partners,” he said, calling the talks “an opportunity to expand bilateral trade and strengthen the partnership.”Lutnick: India–US agreement is ‘not-too-distant’On the American side, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed confidence that the India–US trade deal was within reach. Speaking at the US–India Strategic Partnership Forum earlier in June, Lutnick said both sides had made considerable progress.“I think to be in a very, very good place, and you should expect a deal between the United States and India in the not-too-distant future because I think we found a place that really works for both countries,” Lutnick said.When asked about his outlook, Lutnick replied, “Very optimistic,” adding lightly, “It could be sort of the way I come across.”US officials are reportedly focused on easing market access barriers and aligning standards on medical devices, digital trade, and agricultural exports. India, meanwhile, is expected to press for more favourable terms on services and regulatory protections for its domestic sectors.China deal shifts attention back to IndiaWhile Trump offered few details about the India talks, he was more forthcoming about the recently concluded China agreement. The deal—confirmed earlier this week—revived terms from a stalled framework in Geneva, which includes Beijing resuming rare earth exports to the US.The Geneva understanding, reached in May, had been delayed as China imposed countermeasures in response to new US tariffs. These included suspending the export of critical minerals, disrupting supply chains for industries including electric vehicles, defence manufacturing and semiconductors.Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote in all caps, “Our deal with China is done.” He confirmed that China would supply “full magnets, and any necessary rare earths...up front.”The White House later clarified that both governments had agreed to a framework to implement the Geneva accord. “The administration and China agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement,” a senior official said, adding that the focus was “about how we can implement expediting rare earths shipments to the U.S. again.”Speaking to Bloomberg, Lutnick confirmed the deal was signed two days ago and includes China’s renewed commitment to supply rare earth elements—key components in everything from wind turbines to jet engines.Commerce Secretary Lutnick added: “They’re going to deliver rare earths to us” and once that begins, “we'll take down our countermeasures.”Rare earths at the centre of the dealThis trade pact revives stalled progress on rare earth exports—materials vital to high-tech and defence industries. While rare earths are not rare in nature, China controls a dominant share of global processing capacity. The deal gives US manufacturers a potential reprieve, though it remains conditional. American countermeasures, such as export curbs on chip design software and ethane shipments, will only be lifted after China begins deliveries.Notably, the Commerce Department had earlier permitted American energy companies to load ethane—used in plastics production—onto tankers for China-bound voyages. But actual unloading still requires separate clearance. The gesture signals goodwill but remains incomplete without follow-through from Beijing.With the China agreement now signed, President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to finalise a series of trade deals with other major partners. “We’re going to do top 10 deals, put them in the right category, and then these other countries will fit behind,” Lutnick told Bloomberg Television. The deals are being timed around a self-imposed July 9 deadline, after which Trump may reinstate suspended tariffs of up to 50% if talks fail to yield results. “If people want to come back and negotiate further, they’re entitled to,” Lutnick said. “But that tariff rate will be set and off we’ll go.”The president has also floated the idea of sending formal letters to countries that miss the July deadline, outlining fixed trade terms. These nations would be sorted into “proper buckets,” depending on their willingness to engage or re-engage.While India is not a part of the China rare earth agreement, the timing of Trump’s comments suggests that New Delhi is next in Washington’s trade queue.The ongoing discussions reflect a shift in tone from previous years, when trade tensions between India and the US had surfaced over issues like digital services taxes, medical device pricing, and data localisation rules. Now, both countries are looking for ways to harmonise interests.For India, a well-crafted trade agreement with the US could help improve access for its services sector, encourage inward investment, and formalise economic ties with one of its most significant partners.The coming weeks may determine whether this “very big” deal—described in Trump’s words—takes final shape. For now, it’s a waiting game, but one with real stakes for Indian businesses, policymakers and consumers alike.(With inputs from ANI, Bloomberg)(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onIndia US trade dealDonald Trumpbilateral trade agreementPiyush Goyaltrade negotiations India USIndia US economic relationsUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnickstrategic partnershipChina trade agreementWhite House(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Despite trade tensions and customer demands for diversification, Ah Biao is expanding into Vietnam to mitigate risks, offering incentives to retain experienced workers.TIL CreativesWhen Trump hiked tariffs on China from 54% to 145% in early April, Ah Biao — a moniker his colleagues and friends call him — rented a factory in northern VietnamAh Biao, the founder of a toy factory in southern China that makes magnetic puzzles and sensory tubes for American children, is still in business despite brinkmanship by US President Donald Trump.When Trump hiked tariffs on China from 54% to 145% in early April, Ah Biao — a moniker his colleagues and friends call him — rented a factory in northern Vietnam. He packed 90 sets of iron or steel molds into 60 boxes, some weighing over than 700 kilograms (1,540 pounds), which were shipped to the Southeast Asian country for production to evade levies.Four weeks later, Trump abruptly lowered those tariffs back down to 30% in a 90-day truce with Beijing. Those same molds were quickly moved from a Chinese border town where they were awaiting customs clearance and rushed back into production in Shenzhen.Some production lines are operating 24 hours per day in two shifts. Furloughed workers — who kept their jobs after Ah Biao decided not to implement a plan to lay off a third of them — returned with full pay and overtime. Sixty more people were hired. In the meantime, Ah Biao is fervently keeping track of what’s left of shipping availability to get his toys into the US as quickly as possible.Ah Biao, founder of Shenzhen Kate Plastic Products Co., is emblematic of millions of exporters across China’s vast $4.7 trillion manufacturing sector. For all the attention on Trump’s pledge to bring mass manufacturing back to American shores, one thing has become clear: China’s factories are finding ways to remain central to the global supply chain.Live Events“I felt that it was useless to just worry, you just have to do what you have to do. We can only act according to circumstances,” said Ah Biao, who declined to use his full name due to sensitivities around discussing geopolitical topics, of the ups and downs of the past few months. “In short, the world is round, and we will always find a way.”That was already evident from the US President’s first trade war with China, when exporters responded to tariffs by pouring out into Southeast Asia; Chinese businesses own over half of Cambodia’s factories now, according to the country’s industry ministry. Now in Trump’s second, more damaging trade barrage, the exporters are also more determined to survive.The abrupt whiplash of trade negotiations has underscored the nimble resourcefulness of Chinese exporters, and their ability to stay relevant even as scores of countries try to slow the flow of imports from the world’s second-largest economy.“The US was willing to lower tariffs because it’s very unlikely that Chinese products can be totally replaced in the short term,” said Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas SA. “From the US standpoint, this was essentially a stress test that made it clear that there’s no way to break away from China’s supply chain in a short period of time.”Ah Biao, known to his US customers as Bill, said the company always valued relationships with American clients, who delivered large, stable orders for years uninterrupted — the US is its biggest market.During the supply chain and geopolitical chaos of the pandemic, the company’s clients started asking it to look into diversifying manufacturing from China. He spent a month in Vietnam in 2022 in search of a new production base, but was disheartened by what he saw — upfront rental costs were extremely high, hiring skilled workers was difficult and shipping raw materials and equipment from China was expensive. The challenges there made the company realize it would take more time than expected to plan for the move.In the years since, Ah Biao said the company maintained good relations with his US clients, the biggest of which is Learning Resources Inc., a retailer of educational toys. His factory produces educational toys for the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based company, which sued the Trump administration in April over the tariffs. At its peak, as much as 80% of Learning Resources’s products were made in China, Chief Executive Officer Rick Woldenberg told Bloomberg News, but as US relations with China worsened he decided to build up supply chains elsewhere. “After Trump 1.0, we believed that the clock was ticking and our fear was not Mr. Xi,” he said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping. “Our fear was American politicians.” Woldenberg, whose products include the popular Farmer’s Market color sorting game and the Code and Go Robot Mouse sold online and at stores including Target and Walmart, said he sees no choice but to move manufacturing away from China. He’s had tough conversations with long-term suppliers over the last several months.“We’ve told our factories they need to move and we’ve told them that it’s an urgent matter and we told them we have to move,” he said. “I don’t know where is safe. I can tell you that the wind is blowing in such a way that I don’t feel secure in my future to have a manufacturer in China — I really don’t.”At the start of 2025, about 60% of Learning Resources’s products came from China, with the rest sourced from Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere. That level, Woldenberg said, is “low for our industry, but we now know not low enough.”While some see Trump’s attempt to curb imports from China in the context of a superpower rivalry between the world’s two biggest economies, manufacturers have yet to receive any direct state support.Officials are concerned about manufacturers’ plans to lay off workers or shift overseas, but financial assistance is unlikely as local governments in China are grappling with high debt levels, said multiple Guangdong-based Chinese exporters and one government worker who have direct knowledge of such discussions, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to sensitivities around the issue.The Department of Commerce of Guangdong Province didn’t reply to a faxed request for comment.The US and China agreed to maintain tariffs at their current, lower levels following discussions in London earlier this month. But Ah Biao no longer holds out hope that things between the US and China will improve in the longer term.“It would be great if the two sides talk and make compromises, but it won’t bother me much if it doesn’t go well,” said Ah Biao. “We’ve been through the worst.”That pushed Ah Biao to pull the trigger finally on his Vietnam move, and he isn’t the only one. In the first quarter of this year, combined investment from China and Hong Kong into Vietnam reached nearly $2 billion, up 23% from the year before, according to Vietnamese government data. “We are hearing from Chinese companies,” said John Dwyer, founder of Peregrine Management International, a Hanoi-based firm that assists companies looking to relocate to Vietnam. “Their customers want to start production in Vietnam factories. They are looking for ways to de-risk themselves.”Shifting to Vietnam inevitably means that some of Ah Biao’s workers must relocate, too. To sweeten the offer for his more senior employees, Ah Biao said that he may consider to raise their compensation by 50% at least, with guaranteed vacation time for them to go back to China to see their families.It’s a big, and expensive, gamble for Ah Biao, but at 40, retirement is still too far away to contemplate folding. He thinks he’s young enough to make big bets during a time of turmoil to scale up his business, but he has learned a valuable lesson of not putting all of one’s eggs into one basket. “I always tell my people that we should act like an ‘unkillable cockroach,’” said Ah Biao. “It’s deeply embedded in our DNA.”Read More News onah biodonald trumptrump tariffsus vs chinaus tariffs chinaRead More News onah biodonald trumptrump tariffsus vs chinaus tariffs chinaPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionPunit Goenka reloads Zee with Bullet and OTT focus.

The US seeks lower tariffs on farm exports, but India is cautious due to its large rural workforce and concerns over competition in sectors like pharmaceuticals.ANIIndia-US trade deal (Image for representation)Hopes of finalising an interim trade agreement between India and the United States are now hanging by a thread. Talks between the two sides have hit a stalemate due to unresolved disputes over duties on steel, auto parts, and agricultural goods, Reuters reported on June 26 citing Indian government sources. The impasse is particularly significant as it comes ahead of the July 9 deadline set by President Donald Trump for imposing reciprocal tariffs.As the big deadline approaches, both countries must urgently weigh the economic stakes against political and strategic realities, experts say. For now though, the prospects of a breakthrough remain uncertain.A core issue in the standoff is agriculture. The United States is pressing India to significantly reduce tariffs on American farm exports such as corn, wheat, soybean, and ethanol. However, India’s large rural workforce depends on farming, making it politically difficult for the government to allow an influx of subsidised US produce.New Delhi also remains cautious about opening up domestic sectors like pharmaceuticals, automotive components, and small-scale industries, all of which fear losing ground to American competition.Washington has been demanding wider access not just to agricultural goods but also to US-made automobiles, dairy products, medical equipment, alcoholic beverages, and pharmaceutical items. Despite India offering certain concessions, there is a growing sentiment in New Delhi that the US has not responded with concrete reciprocal offers. Policymakers cite what they call a “lack of reciprocity,” especially in light of the US's unpredictable trade policies.Live EventsUnspoken limits threaten strategic partnership While India views the United States as a crucial strategic ally—especially in contrast to China—there is clear reluctance to give up policy space on global trade matters. New Delhi values its autonomy in foreign policy, even as economic ties with the US deepen.The US remains India’s top trading partner and a significant source of investment, defence equipment, energy, and advanced technologies. However, recent geopolitical developments have sparked unease. For instance, President Trump’s apparent tilt towards Pakistan during a past India-Pakistan standoff has cast a shadow over the reliability of the US as a strategic partner. Indian officials have grown more cautious, balancing economic engagement with strategic restraint.There are also concerns over US tariffs on Indian goods. These include a base tariff of 10%, and sector-specific duties such as 50% on steel and aluminium, and 25% on automobile imports. Although a 26% reciprocal duty on Indian goods is still pending, the looming threat adds to exporter anxiety in India.Trade still growing, despite frictionDespite the friction, India’s exports to the US continue to rise. In 2024, merchandise exports crossed $87 billion. Key sectors include pharmaceuticals ($8 billion), gems and jewellery ($8.5 billion), and petrochemicals (around $4 billion). Services exports—dominated by IT, finance, and professional services—stood at $33 billion for the same year.India's exporters benefit from tariff advantages over competitors such as China and Vietnam, which keeps expectations for further growth optimistic. At the same time, US foreign direct investment in India remains strong. American companies have invested more than $68 billion in India between 2002 and 2024, underscoring confidence in the long-term economic relationship.On the other side, US manufacturers are seeking relief from high Indian tariffs, which range from 7% on wood and machinery to as much as 68% on food products. In 2024, US exports of manufactured goods to India were valued at nearly $42 billion. According to the White House, the US applies an average tariff of just 5% on farm imports, in contrast to India’s 39%, highlighting the imbalance at the heart of the negotiations.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onindia us tradeindia us trade dealtrumptarifftrump tariff deadlinereciprocal tariff(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)
